Mathematically, the specification (*Spec*) is a function from the set of
all initial states (*St*) to the set of all code unit behaviors (*B*).
The specification function may be a partial or total. In set notation:

<pre>
Spec ∈ St × B
</pre>

Intuitively, the specification defines the code unit's behavior when
executed from a given state. In other words, if we know the initial
state, we can use the specification to look up the corresponding code
unit behavior.

A specification is not required to cover all possible initial states. In
other words, a specification may leave the behavior undefined for many
initial states. Such a specification is a "partial" specification. A
specification which defines the behavior for all possible initial states
is a "total" specification.

A specification must not define more than one behavior for a given
program state.

## Specifications as tables

A specification is typically represented by a table with two columns:
initial state and behavior.

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = false</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = true</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

In this specification, executing the code unit from an initial state
where *t* = *true* results in the code unit terminating in a state where
*y* = 3.

The corresponding row is highlighted below.

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = false</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="highlight1">t = true</td>
      <td class="highlight1">terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

## States as predicates

In the specification above, *t* = *true* is not a set of initial states,
it is a predicate. There are an infinite number of initial states which
satisfy this predicate:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">t = true</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 37)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 705)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (system_has_available_memory)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ ¬(system_has_available_memory)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (the_sky_is_blue)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (the_sky_is_red)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(t = true) ∧ ...</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Of course, it's impossible for us to list every initial state satisfying
*t* = *true*. So we use the predicate *t* = *true* in the specification
table with the understanding that it is shorthand for the set of all
initial states where *t* = *true*. In set notation:

<pre>
{s ∈ St | t = true}
</pre>

## Behaviors as predicates

In the specification above, "terminates with y = 3" represents an
infinite number of possible behaviors. For example, all of the following
code units terminate with *y* = *3*:

{% highlight csharp %}
// Code unit 1
y = 3;

// Code unit 2
Sleep(10000); // Sleep for 10 seconds
y = 3;

// Code unit 3
t = false; // Set t
z = y - 1000; // Set z
y = 3;

// Code unit 4
InitiateBankAccountTransfer();
y = 3;

/* et cetera... */
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, it is impossible for us to specify every detail of a
behavior. So we list the predicate "terminates with y = 3" as a
constraint on the allowed behaviors, with the understanding that it is
shorthand for the set of all behaviors where "terminates with y = 3" is
true. In set notation:

<pre>
{b ∈ B | terminates(b) ∧ y = 3}
</pre>

*(There are additional, implicit constraints on behaviors defined in
specifications. These are given in other rules.)*

## Total specifications

A total specification is a specification that defines the code unit's
behavior for all possible initial states.

For example, if *t* is a boolean variable, then this is a total
specification:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = false</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = true</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

For any state we invent, *t* is either going to be true or false, since
those are the only two values the boolean variable *t* can have.

Even if we do not explicitly list *t* in our state predicate, *t* still
has either a true or false value in our state. For example, consider the
state predicate:

<pre>
z = 82
</pre>

There are an infinite number of possible states which satisfy this
predicate:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">State</th>
      <th class="left">z = 82</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (t = false)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (t = true)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (y = 705) ∧ (t = false)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (system_has_available_memory) ∧ (t = false)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ ¬(system_has_available_memory) ∧ (t = false)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (the_sky_is_blue) ∧ (t = true)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ (y = 37) ∧ (the_sky_is_red) ∧ (t = false)</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(z = 82) ∧ ...</td>
      <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Notice that in each state, *t* has a value, regardless of whether or not
we choose to include the value of *t* in our description of the state.

Just because the state predicate says nothing about the value of *t*, it
does not mean *t* has no value in states which satisfy the predicate.
Similarly, the state predicate *z* = 82 says nothing about the color of
the sky, but this does not mean the sky has no color.

## Partial specifications

A partial specification is a specification that leaves the behavior
undefined for some set of initial states.

For example, if *x* is an integer variable, then this is a partial
specification:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(0 ≤ x) ∧ (x ≤ 5)</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7 ≤ x</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The specification does not define a behavior for initial states where
(*x* < 0) ∨ (*x* = 6). States which satisfy this predicate are outside
of the specification domain.

## Inconsistent specifications

An inconsistent specification is a specification that defines more than
one behavior for a given initial state.

For example, if *x* is an integer variable, then this is an inconsistent
specification:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(0 ≤ x) ∧ (x ≤ 5)</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 ≤ x</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

In states where *x* = 5, the specification defines two behaviors: one
where *y* = 0, and one where *y* = 3. Of course, *y* cannot equal both 0
and 3.

Inconsistent specifications can be harder to spot when more than one
variable is involved. Consider the following specification, where *t* is
a boolean variable and *x* is an integer variable:

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="left">Initial State</th>
      <th class="left">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(0 ≤ x) ∧ (x ≤ 5)</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t = false</td>
      <td>terminates with y = 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The specification defines two behaviors for any initial state which
satisfies the predicate (0 ≤ *x*) ∧ (*x* ≤ 5) ∧ (*t* = false).

Mathematically, for a specification which maps state predicates *P* and
*Q* to different behaviors, the following must be true for the
specification to be consistent:

<pre>
{s ∈ St | P(s)} ∩ {t ∈ St | Q(t)} = ∅
</pre>
