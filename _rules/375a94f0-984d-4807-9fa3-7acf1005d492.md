  Never handle invalid enumeration values.

When you use an enumeration type as the declared type of an input, you
create an explicit precondition that the value passed from calling code
is a valid member of the enumeration type. Valid members of an
enumeration type are those defined in the enumeration at the time your
assembly is compiled. Since an invalid enumeration value is a
precondition violation, it must not be handled ({% include
rule-link.html uuid="1a602c70-f177-47ad-a023-87fec7ec5146" %}).

If your code cannot rely on callers to ensure this precondition, then
there is no added benefit from using the enumeration type as the
declared type of the input, and you must instead use the enumeration's
underlying integral type as the declared type of the input.

You may flag invalid enumeration values in debug builds (e.g. by
throwing an exception). This is an instance of precondition checking.
