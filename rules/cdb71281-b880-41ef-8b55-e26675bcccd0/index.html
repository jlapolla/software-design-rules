    <h2 id="preconditions-exist-only-at-runtime">Preconditions exist only at runtime</h2>

<p>There are at least two common uses for the word “precondition”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A constraint on the state of the universe which the caller must
satisfy before executing a piece of code. This constraint is specified
in the source code documentation as part of the code’s <a href="https://www.eiffel.org/doc/glossary#Contract">contract</a>.
It does not vary at runtime. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precondition#In_object-oriented_programming">Design by contract</a> uses the word
precondition in this sense. <em>(Further reading: <a href="https://www.eiffel.org/doc/glossary#Precondition">Eiffel</a>)</em></li>
  <li>The state of the universe that exists at runtime immediately before a
piece of code executes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare logic</a> uses the word precondition in
this sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two uses of the word precondition lead to statements that seem
contradictory. For example: the “Liskov substitution principle” says <a href="http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/187613">we
<em>CANNOT</em> strengthen the precondition</a>, while the “consequence rule”
in Hoare logic says <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/65440">we <em>CAN</em> strengthen the precondition</a>. These two
rules are not contradictory, they just use different senses of the word
precondition.</p>

<p>This site adopts the Hoare logic definition of the word precondition. To
avoid confusion, this site uses the word “<a href="/software-design-rules/rules/3b905612-0300-494f-8a47-9a700d3d615b/" title="The domain of a piece of code is the set of preconditions for which the code&#39;s execution behavior is defined. ">domain</a>” for the
design by contract sense of the word precondition (though a domain is
slightly different from a design by contract precondition).</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-the-universe">The state of the universe</h2>

<p>The <em>“state of the universe”</em> includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The state of all variables in the executing program.</li>
  <li>The state of the hardware the program is executing on. For example:
available memory, CPU temperature, power source stability, et cetera.</li>
  <li>The state of the physical world. For example: in robotics, a physical
barrier in front of the robot can affect the outcome of the execution
of a piece of code.</li>
  <li>Everything.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-notation">Set notation</h2>

<p>The set of all possible preconditions is denoted by <em>U</em>.</p>

<p>The set of all possible preconditions is equal to the set of all
possible states of the universe.</p>
