snippet: Never declare a precondition that the client cannot ensure.

In [design by contract][1], it is the client's responsibility to ensure
the [precondition][2]. If the client cannot ensure the precondition, the
client cannot safely call the supplier. The supplier which declares an
unverifiable precondition is essentially unusable.

## Define failure behavior

This does not prevent us from defining supplier behavior in the event of
an unforseeable failure.

Consider a user login API:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class LoginManager
{

  public void Login(string username, string password) { /* ... */ }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The client cannot ensure that the supplied `username` and `password`
combination is valid. Therefore, according to the rule,
`LoginManager.Login` cannot declare *"The supplied `username` and
`password` must be valid"* as part of its precondition. The precondition
must allow an invalid `username` and `password` combination, and
`LoginManager.Login` must have {% include rule-link.html
uuid="e1023324-1686-4c0a-a2b8-dc8d3360ae9e" text="a defined behavior for
this situation"%}.
