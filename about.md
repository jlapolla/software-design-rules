This site presents one consistent set of software design rules. The
rationale for each rule is also presented. The rules promote effective
development.

## It's not a holy war

Some developers follow a different set of rules. Some developers do not
follow any set of rules at all.

And that's okay! There is always more than one solution to any given
problem in software.

We are not asserting that the rules on this site are the only possible
solution to promoting effective development, nor are we asserting that
you are wrong if you don't follow the rules. We are only asserting that
the rules are one possible solution.

## The rules are...

### Absolute

Each rule is stated as an absolute truth. Known exceptions to the rule
are documented as part of the rule. Exceptions to the rule are never
ambiguous.

The language of a rule indicates whether it has any documented
exceptions. Rules that use "always" or "never" do not have documented
exceptions. All other rules have documented exceptions.

### Strict

There is always more than one solution to any given problem in software.
Wherever possible, the rules restrict you to a single solution. These
restrictions:

- Accelerate development by minimizing the decisions the developer has
  to make.
- Promote consistency.

### Imperative or declarative

Imperative rules command the developer to do something.

Declarative rules express a general truth. While declarative rules do
not explicitly tell the developer to do something, they help the
developer understand certain properties of his software.

### Evolving

When a developer disagrees with a rule, he may review the rule's
rationale. If he still disagrees with the rule, he may:

- Add an exception to the rule for his specific case.
- Create a new rule to handle his specific case.
- Rewrite the rule entirely.
- Any combination of these.

Thus the rules are refined over time as we encounter new situations.
