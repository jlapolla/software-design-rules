## Preconditions exist only at runtime

There are at least two common uses for the word "precondition":

- A constraint on the state of the universe which the caller must
  satisfy before executing a piece of code. This constraint is specified
  in the source code documentation as part of the code's [contract][3].
  It does not vary at runtime. [Design by contract][1] uses the word
  precondition in this sense. *(Further reading: [Eiffel][2])*
- The state of the universe that exists at runtime immediately before a
  piece of code executes. [Hoare logic][4] uses the word precondition in
  this sense.

These two uses of the word precondition lead to statements that seem
contradictory. For example: the "Liskov substitution principle" says [we
*CANNOT* strengthen the precondition][5], while the "consequence rule"
in Hoare logic says [we *CAN* strengthen the precondition][6]. These two
rules are not contradictory, they just use different senses of the word
precondition.

This site adopts the Hoare logic definition of the word precondition. To
avoid confusion, this site uses the word "{% include rule-link.html
uuid="3b905612-0300-494f-8a47-9a700d3d615b" text="domain" %}" for the
design by contract sense of the word precondition (though a domain is
slightly different from a design by contract precondition).

## The state of the universe

The *"state of the universe"* includes:

- The state of all variables in the executing program.
- The state of the hardware the program is executing on. For example:
  available memory, CPU temperature, power source stability, et cetera.
- The state of the physical world. For example: in robotics, a physical
  barrier in front of the robot can affect the outcome of the execution
  of a piece of code.
- Everything.

## Set notation

The set of all possible preconditions is denoted by *U*.

The set of all possible preconditions is equal to the set of all
possible states of the universe.
