## It's not a design by contract "precondition"

The concept of a domain is similar to the design by contract concept of
a [precondition][1]. The difference is that the design by contract
precondition defines the set of states in which a piece of code will
execute successfully, whereas a domain defines the set of states in
which a piece of code will execute in a defined manner.

For example, consider a user login manager:

{% highlight csharp %}
{% endhighlight %}
