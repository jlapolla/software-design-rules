  A "state variable": a member of a state space which has a particular
  value at a particular state.

## Example

Consider the following C# program:

{% highlight csharp %}
struct Program
{

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {

    int x = 3;
    int y = args.Length;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The values of the variables *x* and *y* both characterize the program
[state][2]. Therefore *x* and *y* are state variables.

For example, the program could have one of the following states
(expressed as [ordered pairs][4]):

〈*x* = 3, *y* = 356〉<br />
〈*x* = 3, *y* = 18〉<br />
〈*x* = 3, *y* = 0〉

To summarize, state variables are the values that characterize states.

## Mathematical summary

A state variable is the set of possible values for that variable. From
our example, we have (using [set notation][3]):

*x* = {... , -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}<br />
*y* = {... , -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}<br />
